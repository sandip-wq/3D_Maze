# 3D Maze Project using Three.js

## Overview
This project demonstrates a 3D maze created using Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for 3D graphics in web applications. The maze includes walls, a player controlled via keyboard input, entrance and exit indicators, lighting effects, and a congratulatory message upon reaching the exit.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository(https://github.com/sandip-wq/3D_Maze) to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a modern web browser that supports WebGL.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
4. Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to navigate the player through the maze.
5. Reach the exit marked "Exit Here" to display the congratulatory message.

## Technologies Used

This project makes use of the following technologies:

- **Three.js**: A popular JavaScript library for creating and rendering 3D scenes.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A library used for animations.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for the basic structure and styling of the webpage.

## Features

The project includes the following features:

- **Scene Setup**: Initializes the 3D scene, camera, and renderer.
- **Lighting**: Includes directional and ambient lighting for realistic effects.
- **Maze Generation**: Defines a maze structure using a 2D array.
- **Player and Controls**: Allows the player to navigate the maze using arrow keys or WASD keys.
- **Collision Detection**: Prevents the player from moving through walls.
- **Exit Detection**: Detects when the player reaches the maze exit and displays a congratulatory message.
- **Text Rendering**: Uses a loader to render text in 3D space.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file defining the structure of the webpage, including scripts and styles.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for basic styling of the HTML elements.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for setting up the scene, defining the maze structure, player movement, collision detection, and exit detection.
